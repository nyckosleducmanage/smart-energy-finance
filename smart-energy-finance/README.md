## ⚠️ Important recommendation

For the best results, it is **strongly recommended** to use:

* ✅ daily energy counters in **kWh**
* ❌ NOT raw power sensors in **W**

Why:

* more accurate calculations
* better long-term stability
* reliable daily / monthly / yearly history
* fewer errors and drift over time

Power sensors can work in some cases, but energy counters remain the best and most reliable solution.

## 🔌 Compatibility

This module is compatible with:

* inverters
* solar panels
* battery systems
* Home Assistant energy sensors
* custom entities from other add-ons or integrations

It is designed to remain flexible and can work with many different system types as long as the required Home Assistant entities are available.
